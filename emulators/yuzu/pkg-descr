yuzu is an experimental open-source Nintendo Switch emulator/debugger
written in C++. It is written with portability in mind, with builds
actively maintained for Windows, Linux and OS X. yuzu only emulates a
subset of Switch hardware, and therefore is generally only useful for
running/debugging homebrew applications. At this time, yuzu cannot
play any commercial games without major problems. yuzu can boot some
games, to varying degrees of success, but does not implement any of the
necessary GPU features to render 3D graphics.
